we are going to build is an API with AWS services
we are going to build is an API that allows you to query data being stored in Amazon S3 bucket object store service.  Generally, developers do not allow people to query the data from an S3 bucket directly or expose key data directly to their consumers for security and design reasons. Instead, data is exposed to consumers via an API or application programming interface.  We will demonstrate how to build out an API using Amazon API Gateway to expose that data securely.

The data being stored in S3 is a record of Patients which can be accessed via the internet.  We have a JSON file that contains information about each patient that we are aware of. This is an example of one Patient record represented in JSON. So have a id, first name, last name, address . We are going to design a system to make that possible. 
So Today I'm  going to be building a backend API to demonstrate how to use a variety of AWS services
